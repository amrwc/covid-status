# Terminal Preview

The Terminal session recording is done with [termtosvg][termtosvg].

## Setup

1. Install `termtosvg` with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   $ brew install termtosvg
   ```

1. Set Terminal window to preferred size as the recording will preserve it.
1. Start recording by typing `termtosvg`. The lines emitted by the utility
   won't appear in the recording.
